# Python-Challenge

The Python challenge presents the task of creating a script for both budget_data and election data CSV files that analyzes financial records of my company. If the execution is successful it should present this output error free:

--PyBank--

- The total number of months.

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

--PyPoll--

- The total number of votes cast.

- A complete list of candidates who received votes.

- The percentage of votes each candidate won.

- The total number of votes each candidate won.

- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Additional code was added to both scripts to export the results to a text file.


*Technologies used: Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

*How to activate code: The files for each dataset sit in the 'PyBank' and PyPoll
folders under the name 'main.py'. You can open these files in your preferred Python
IDEs and run the script. Even though txt files for both are in the analysis folder, you will
see another set of txt files when both codes are executed.

Notes: For both scripts I ran code that imported the contents of the CSV files and looped
through the data allowing me to get the necessary information required for completion of the challenge.
I had originally used Pandas for this exercise but was later informed that I had to use plain python 
script, so that meant going back and re-working everything.
